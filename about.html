<u>Name</u>: Aaron Kay Yam Chan (search me on Facebook!)<br/><br/><br/>
<u>About Me</u>:  
<p style="text-align:justify">
<i>Mathematic background</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a post-doc at Uppsala Universitet.  Having recently finished my PhD at the University of Aberdeen, under the supervision of Dr William Turner, funded by EPSRC.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Keywords of my research interest: Koszul algebras, quasi-hereditary algebras, representation-finite self-injective algebras, derived equivalence, stable equivalence,  Auslander-Reiten theory.<br/>
My current research projects contain the following keywords:<br/> Brauer graph algebras; 2-representation theory; higher Auslander-Reiten theory; simple-minded systems.
</p>

<!--
<p>I am also interested in algebraic number theory, its connection with representation theory of finite dimensional algebra and cohomology, but I am not researching on these at the moment.  So I will be very happy to have any inspiring discussion on this topic.
</p>-->
<p style="text-align:justify">
I took my undergraduate degree at University of Cambridge, matriculated at October 2006, and took the Part III CASM as a student under DPMMS.  I wrote an essay on &quot;Blocks with cyclic defect group&quot; under supervision of Dr Stuart Martin, the essay can be found in the Maths page.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<i>Personal background</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was born in England but my family, who were originally from Hong Kong, moved back to Hong Kong when I was 2, and we moved back to the UK when I was 16.
</p>

<br/>

<u>Hobbies/Interests</u>:<br/>
<p style="text-align:justify">
-Listen to (almost) all kinds of music all day.  My recent played tracks recorded by last.fm:<br/>
<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/dvleo/?chartstyle=fe7TenTracks"><img src="http://imagegen.last.fm/fe7TenTracks/recenttracks/dvleo.gif" border="0" alt="dvleo's Profile Page" /></a>   <br/><br/>

-Yoyo (my expertise is on 1A and 5A, and I am currently learning 2A,3A,4A........), I have played for some years but havn't improved much since I come to UK.  However, I was lucky enough to get a 3rd place once in the UK Championship years ago.<br/><br/>

-Devil-Stick, but I only know the basics, didn't keep on learning it after 2 years in the UK<br/><br/>

-Rubik's Cube (best time is only 40s, far from being intermediate level player)<br/><br/>

-Playing in band, I usually play the drum or bass guitar.  I am a beginner on guitar and I can't sing!  I was a member of a band in Cambridge formed by Hong Kong students of the Uni.Cam.<br/><br/>

-(Game and Math) Programming; I probably forgot most of the stuff on game programming already now... I am still (almost) fluent in C/C++, although I tends to use MATLAB these days.  I can probably pick up JAVA and Maple again in less than a few hours since I have used them for quite a few times before.  To include the list of programming/scripting language I learnt (or used/touched), in order of fluency: HTML, JavaScript/CSS, PHP, R, Mathematica, PARI, BASIC, (Moscow)ML.<br/><br/>

-Music video directing, filming, cutting.  See what I have done:<br/>

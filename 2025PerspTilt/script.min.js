In this talk, we first adopt a geometric perspective to see the significance of\n                    Hom-orthogonality in the context of a conjecture that I posed in 2019, now known as the Second\n                    Brick-Brauer-Thrall (2nd bBT) Conjecture. Then, we show that some of the more recent bBT conjectures\n                    actually follow from the 2nd bBT conjecture. This provides new insights into these challenging open\n                    problems.

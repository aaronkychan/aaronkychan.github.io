## Submitted talk title and abstract

    -   Cohen-Macaulay representations of invariant subrings
    -   The two-dimensional quotient singularities provide examples of rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type. Furthermore, the Auslander-Reiten quivers of the categories of Cohen-Macaulay modules coincide with the McKay quivers (algebraic McKay correspondence). Conversely, two-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type are precisely quotient singularities if their residue fields are algebraically closed and of characteristic zero. In this talk, we generalize the above classical results to situations where the coefficient fields are not necessarily algebraically closed by introducing quotient singularities admitting field extensions. Moreover, we will see how to draw the McKay quivers in this new setting through determining irreducible representations of skew group algebras.

    -   On (Co)silting Bijections Involving the Category of Large Projective Presentations (Injective Corepresentations)
    -   Based on results by Adachi-Iyama-Reiten, Marks-Šťovíček, Pauksztello-Zvonareva and Adachi-Tsukamoto, García successfully completed a commutative 'triangular prism' of bijections connecting the classes of support tau-tilting modules, functorially-finite torsion pairs and left finite wide subcategories in the category of finitely-generated A-modules—where A is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field—to the classes of 'silting objects', complete cotorsion pairs and thick subcategories with enough injectives in the category of projective presentations of objects in mod(A)—which has many powerful properties. In this talk, we will present advances towards generalizing these results to the realm of infinite-dimensional modules over more general classes of rings—and, furthermore, dualizing them to the cosilting side. It is based on joint work in progress with Lidia Angeleri Hügel.

    -   A crystal structure on 2-parameter persistence modules
    -   Persistence modules are representations of a certain quiver with relation used for topological data analysis. We show that the set of irreducible components of moduli space of 2D persistence module has a structure of a Kashiwara crystal. In the $2 \times 2$ case, we give an explicit description of the crystal structure.

    -   Tilting in functor categories
    -   I will survey how the idea of tilting can be used in various functor categories including the category of strict polynomial functors P_d, which is closely related to the category of representations of GL_n. More specifically I will discuss such topics as Koszul duality, de Rham complex and certain form of the Hilbert-Riemann correspondence, which can be studied in P_d.

    -   McKay correspondence in positive characteristic for specific modular groups
    -   Over complex numbers, McKay correspondence can be described as a relation between irreducible representations of finite groups and geometric properties of the associated quotient singularities. However, the naive analog of such relation fails when the ground field has a prime characteristic. In this talk, I will introduce a series of modular groups for what the analogous McKay correspondence in positive characteristic holds, and discuss about a potential way to adjust the analog such that it works for more groups in positive characteristic.

    -   Classifying KE-closed subcategories over a commutative ring
    -   Classifying subcategories is an active subject in the representation theory of algebras. Especially, several subcategories of the module category of a commutative noetherian ring have been classified so far. In this talk, we will give a classification result of KE-closed subcategories (additive subcategories closed under extensions and kernels) for a commutative noetherian ring.

    -   Tilting for Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one
    -   The existence of tilting or silting objects is a significant feature in algebraic triangulated categories, as it establishes an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. In this study, we focus on the existence of tilting objects in the stable category of Cohen-Macaulay modules over Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras. These algebras extend the concept of Gorenstein commutative rings from the perspective of noncommutative algebraic geometry. In the representation theory of a Gorenstein commutative ring, the Gorenstein parameter plays a crucial role. This talk provides a characterization of the existence of tilting objects in stable categories using Gorenstein parameters. Our result is a noncommutative generalization of results established by Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura.

    -   Higher-dimensionalization of abelian categories via DG-categories.
    -   In this lecture, we introduce a higher-dimensional analogue of abelian categories in DG categories as an axiomatization of subcategories called n-extended hearts of t-structures in triangulated categories, and provide an overview of the fundamental theory.

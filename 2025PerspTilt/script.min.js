The $A$-module structures on the vector space $\\Bbbk^d$, $d\\ge 1$, form an affine\nvariety $\\mathrm{mod}_A(d)$ called a module variety. The general linear group $\\mathrm{GL}(d)$ acts regularly\non $\\mathrm{mod}_A(d)$ such that the orbits correspond bijectively to the isomorphism classes of $d$-dimensional $A$-modules. The orbits are locally closed subsets in $\\mathrm{mod}_A(d)$ and their\nclosures (in the Zariski topology) form an interesting class of affine varieties. One can\nask if these varieties are nonsingular, regular in codimension 1 or 2, normal, unibranch,\ncomplete intersections, Cohen-Macaulay, etc. What is more interesting, we would like to\nknow how these geometric properties are reflected in terms of $A$-modules. Instead of modules over a $\\Bbbk$-algebra, we may consider finite dimensional representations of a quiver or a bound quiver. Here we get orbit closures as well. Bongartz showed that the orbit closures\nin module varieties and in the varieties of representations of the corresponding bound quivers are related by associated fibre bundles (in particular, the types of singularities are identical).<br><br>\nDuring the series of lectures we will present old and new results on local geometric properties of orbit closures in varieties of modules (or quiver representations), and their relationship with the spaces of homomorphisms or extensions between modules (or representations). We will also explain geometric relations between representations of quivers, and Schubert and affine Schubert varieties.

It is usually considered for small subgroups $G$ of $GL(n, \\mathbb{C})$, where $G$ is said to be small if $G$ contains no complex reflection. To consider the McKay correspondence for complex\nreflection groups, we consider not just the quotient variety (which is smooth) but the pair consisting of the quotient variety and the discriminant divisor with suitable coefficients. There is a conjectural semi-orthogonal decomposition of the $G$-equivariant derived\ncategory by Polishchuk and Van den Bergh, indexed by the conjugacy classes in $G$. In\ndimension two, the conjecture follows from a theorem of Kawamata.

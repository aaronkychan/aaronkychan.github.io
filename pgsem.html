		<div class="info" id="andrew">
			In this talk I will give the method of constructing the Serre spectral
sequence for homology (I'll point out the obvious dual for cohomology
too) and state (but not prove because it's too long) the convergence
theorem for the spectral sequence. Then I will give a theorem of Serre
which gives a nice way of representing the \(E_2\) page for spaces \(X\) where
we have a fibration \(F \rightarrow X \rightarrow B\), and work through one
(or possibly two) example(s) of how we can use the spectral
sequences.<br/>
<br/>
I may also refer to a couple of books for the proofs:<br/>
McCleary - A User's Guide to Spectral Sequences<br/>
Mosher & Tangora - Cohomology Operations and Applications in Homotopy
Theory.

		<div class="info" id="aaron">
			This is an expository talk on quivers divided into four sections: (1) Intro. to quivers (2) Ext-quiver and results 
(3) Auslander-Reiten theory (4) Examples.<br/>
We assume a basic knowledge of algebras and their representations (projective, injective, iindecomposable and simple modules)
and we will use algebraic and combinatorial arguments throughout (modulo a small amount of geometry in sections 2 and 3).

		<div class="info" id="fergus">
		I will give a brief overview on varieties for modules, particularly
modules over elementary abelian \(p\)-groups. I will say a little about in
what sense a module can be said to have a variety and then proceed to
describe rank varieties for modules over elementary abelian \(p\)-groups,
showing how these relate to the previously defined varieties for
modules. This done I shall give some examples of how using rank
varieties can make it a great deal easier to explicitly calculate the
variety of a module in this situation. If there is time I will finish by
saying a short amount about what I'm working on at the minute relating
to these.
<br/><br/>
In terms of assumed knowledge I'll expect everybody to know basic
cohomology (essentially the definition of Ext should be enough to see
you through) and the definition of a variety. I'll have to make use of
some group cohomology but I'll try and quickly state what I need and
include references for further information. If you know in advance how
the cohomology of a group can be made into a ring that would certainly
help but shouldn't be essential.
